# MarginPerceptron
Implement the margin perceptron algorithm.

##Background
Given a gamma guess to obtain a guaranteed linear classifier when the gamma guess is suitable.
Ortherwise, update the gamme guess by halving the previous gamma guess until the gamma guess is reasonable( gamma guess <= gamma*)
